# WHY SECURITY?

[Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzfI4m-fy8g)

- Billions of $s → 1000s of protocols → 100’s of security experts → huge gap currently
- Very few people who are good with ethereum security
- Need to look from it from a 'security' perspective, not a 'developer' perspective
- 'security' perspective is to analyze attack vectors. Not the job of a developer
- Need to understand bits and bytes
- Need 1000's of security experts
